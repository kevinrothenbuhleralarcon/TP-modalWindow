                <p>You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Throw her in the brig. Yes! In your face, Gandhi!</p>
                <p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Oh, but you can. <strong> But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil.</strong> <em> And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil.</em> And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</p>
                <h2>Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</h2>
                <p>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Can we have Bender Burgers again? Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</p>
                <ol>
                
                    <li>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.</li><li>No argument here.</li><li>Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</li>

                <h3>That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!</h3>
                <p>Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."</p>

                <p>Shut up and take my money! Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. With gusto. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</p>
                <p>Actually, that's still true. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! You mean while I'm sleeping in it? It's toe-tappingly tragic!</p>
                <p>Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!</p>
                <p>Shinier than yours, meatbag. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Why not indeed! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…</p>
                <p>I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. They're like sex, except I'm having them! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
                <p>Who am I making this out to? Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.</p>
                <p>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! No! Don't jump! Large bet on myself in round one. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?</p>
                <p>Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Daylight and everything. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>
                <p>Why did you bring us here? Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Who am I making this out to?</p>
                <p>I'm a thing. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. We don't have a brig. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!</p>
                <p>Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.</p>
